# LSM

An OS and Cyber-security based project that enforces Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security model as a Linux Security Module (LSM).

This differentiates from Discretionary Access Control (DAC) where users can grant or change file permissions. MAC enforces predefined policies that cannot be altered by individual users.

## 1.0.0 Environment

This project is developed and tested in Ubuntu 22.04 using a kernel emulator to load the distro as a Virtual Machine (VM).

To achieve this, VMware workstation and KVM will be used.
